Description: Homogeneity tests of the coefficients in panel data. Currently,
             only the Hsiao test for determining coefficient homogeneity between
             the panel data individuals is implemented, as described in Hsiao
             (2022), "Analysis of Panel Data" (<doi:10.1017/9781009057745>).
